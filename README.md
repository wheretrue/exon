Exon is an analysis toolkit for life-science applications. It features:

* Support for over 10 (and counting) file formats from bioinformatics, proteomics, and others
* Seamless transition between local and object storage (e.g. S3)
* Arrow FFI primitives for multi-language support
* SQL based access to bioinformatics data -- general DML and some DDL support

Please note Exon was recently excised from a larger library, so please be patient as we work to clean up after that. If you have a comment or question in the meantime, please file an issue.

## Installation

Exon is available via crates.io. To install, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
exon = "*"
```

## Usage

Exon is designed to be used as a library. For example, to read a FASTA file:

```rust
use exon::context::ExonSessionExt;

use datafusion::prelude::*;
use datafusion::error::Result;

let ctx = SessionContext::new();

let df = ctx.read_fasta("test-data/datasources/fasta/test.fasta", None).await?;
```

Please see the [rust docs](https://docs.rs/exon) for more information.
